<center><h3>The Fountain of Youth</h3></center>
<center><p>Jack searches for the Fountain of Youth with his lucky compass. He finds a small life boat and map navigation coordinates he stole from the ship and makes his way there. Jack has the Chalices and fills them with a bit of the Fountain water and a tear from a mermaid named Syrena. The Chalice with just water takes life and the chalice with the mermaid tear heals and saves your life. Suddenly, the place is invaded by Spaniards who are after the Chalices.</p></center>

<center><h4>Character Interactions: Blackbeard & Angelica</h4></center>

<center><p>Jack has the Chalices in his hands, one that takes life and the other that has the mermaid tear. Blackbeard and his daughter Angelica become severely injured by his sword which was poisoned by one of the intruders. Angelica wants her father to live, so Jack hands them the Chalices, and they drink them. Jack chimes in and says that he switched them, giving Angelica the one with the mermaid tear. Blackbeard's life is taken and he turns to dust in the wind.</p></center>
